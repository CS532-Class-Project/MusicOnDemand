	   <h3>morning tea 1</h3>
    <p>People in Guangzhou have morning tea, sometimes as
	breakfast, and usually the whole family sits around a
	table to share the happiness of family. Some go to 
	work after drinking morning tea, while others use it 
	for leisure. Most of the leisure people are retired 
	old people in the neighborhood. They are generally 
	the earliest to come and the latest to leave. They 
	can sit in the teahouse from the morning when the 
	teahouse opens until the morning tea "closes". This 
	kind of tea drinkers do not go to luxury restaurants,
	high-end teahouses or hotels, but to economical small
	teahouses on the nearby streets. For example, if you 
	go to a high-end tea house, the per capita 
	consumption can be similar to that of a banquet. 
	"Morning tea" is also a common way for Guangzhou 
	people to socialize.</p>
